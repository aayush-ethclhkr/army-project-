🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python Script)

This Python script is a simple yet powerful validator that checks the strength of a user's password against common security criteria. It uses regular expressions to ensure that the password is both strong and secure.

✨ What It Checks For:

✅ At least 8 characters long
✅ Contains at least one uppercase letter
✅ Contains at least one lowercase letter
✅ Includes at least one digit
✅ Has at least one special character (!@#$%^&*(), etc.)
🛠️ How It Works:
When the user enters a password, the script runs it through a series of checks. If it meets all criteria, it responds with “Strong password!”. Otherwise, it points out exactly what's missing, making it beginner-friendly and easy to fix.

🎯 Use Cases:

Great for login systems or sign-up forms
Ideal for teaching basic cybersecurity hygiene
Lightweight tool for practicing regex and input validation
