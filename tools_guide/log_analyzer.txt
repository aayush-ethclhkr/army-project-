🔍 What does the Log Analyzer do?
Opens a .log file chosen by the user.
Reads each line and checks if it contains:
ERROR ➜ Increases error count
WARNING ➜ Increases warning count
INFO ➜ Increases info count
Searches for a keyword entered by the user (like "USB", "internet") and highlights matching lines.
Displays all matching logs and shows a summary: total Errors, Warnings, and Info.
